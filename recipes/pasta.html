    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Spaghetti or your preferred pasta</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>Fresh parsley</li>
      <li>Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the
        package instructions until al dente. Reserve a cup of pasta cooking
        water before draining.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        In a large skillet, heat a generous amount of extra-virgin olive oil
        over medium heat. Add the minced or sliced garlic to the oil and sauté
        until it becomes fragrant and golden. Be cautious not to burn the
        garlic.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        If you desire a bit of heat, add red pepper flakes to the garlic and oil
        mixture. Adjust the quantity based on your spice preference.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Once the pasta is cooked, transfer it directly from the pot to the
        skillet with the garlic and oil. Toss the pasta to coat it evenly with
        the flavorful mixture.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        If the pasta seems dry, add a bit of the reserved pasta cooking water
        gradually to achieve the desired consistency.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Season the dish with salt and black pepper to taste. Sprinkle chopped
        fresh parsley over the pasta for a burst of color and freshness.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Plate the Aglio e Olio pasta and, if desired, top it with grated
        Parmesan or Pecorino cheese.
      </li>
    </ol>
