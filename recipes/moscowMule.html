    <h2>Donkeys, Mules, and Moscow</h2>

    <p>
      A Moscow Mule is a refreshing and iconic cocktail known for its
      distinctive copper mug presentation. This classic drink typically consists
      of three main ingredients: vodka, ginger beer, and lime juice. The
      <br />
      cocktail is served over ice and garnished with a wedge of lime. The
      combination of the crisp, spicy kick from the ginger beer, the zesty
      acidity from the lime, and the smoothness of the vodka creates a
      <br />
      well-balanced and satisfying beverage. The Moscow Mule has become a
      popular choice for those seeking a flavorful and effervescent cocktail
      with a hint of nostalgia, often enjoyed in its signature copper mug.
